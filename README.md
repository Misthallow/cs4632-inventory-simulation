# CS 4632 – Modeling and Simulation  
## Inventory Management Simulation

### Author
Jasper Zheng

### Project Description
This project implements a discrete-event simulation of a retail inventory system under stochastic demand and lead times.

The goal is to evaluate different inventory control policies, including:
- (s, S) policy
- Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)

The simulation measures:
- total cost
- holding cost
- shortage cost
- stockout rate
- service level
- average inventory

### Simulation Type
Discrete-Event Simulation

### Models Used
- Poisson/Normal demand distributions
- (s, S) inventory control
- EOQ analytical model
- Event scheduling
